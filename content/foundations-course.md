Accessibility is essential for individuals and organizations that want to create high-quality products &mdash; and not exclude people from using their products and services.

The "**[Introduction to Web Accessibility](https://www.edx.org/course/web-accessibility-introduction)**" online course provides a strong foundation for making websites, apps, and other digital technology:

-  work well for people with disabilities
-  meet international standards
-  enhance the user experience for everyone

## Who it is for

{% include_cached blockquote.html class="pull alt-2 right" style="font-size:small" content="<p>It’s for beginners &mdash; <strong>and</strong> also for those who already know some about accessibility and want to broaden their knowledge and perspectives.</p>" source="Shawn Lawton Henry,<br>W3C Accessibility Education and Outreach Coordinator" %}

The course is designed for **technical and non-technical** learners, including:

- developers
- designers
- content authors
- project managers

And also:
- students
- instructors
- people with disabilities

## What you’ll learn
Here are a few of the many things you can learn from this course:
 
- How people with disabilities use digital technology
- The principles of designing and developing accessibly: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust (POUR)
- The W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and other international standards for accessibility
- The business case -- how accessibility can expand market reach, demonstrate social responsibility, drive innovation, and minimize legal risk
- Approaches for planning and managing accessibility in your project and in your organization
- How you can check web pages for some basic accessibility issues and improve accessibility

The syllabus includes:
- What is Web Accessibility (2 sections)
- People and Digital Technology (5 sections)

- Getting Started with Accessibility (2 sections)

**You can learn more about the specific topics you are most interested in** from the optional activities and materials.

## Duration

The course is designed to take about **16-20 hours to complete** for most people. It is listed as 4 weeks of 4-5 hours effort per week.

It is **self-paced** so you can complete it in a shorter or longer time frame.

**Transcript:**

Shadi: I'm Shadi Abou-Zahra, Accessibility Strategy and Technology Specialist at W3C, the World Wide Web Consortium.

Natalia: I'm Natalia Amelina, Senior National Project Officer in Education at the UNESCO Institute for Information Technologies in Education.

Shadi: Join us in this course to learn the fundamental skills and key resources that are becoming increasingly important across digital professions.

Natalia: In according with statistics, people with disabilities can make up around 15% of the population -- and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities recognizes access to information as a human right. And you may know that this Convention was ratified by 180 countries all over the world, very likely including your country too.

Shadi: In this course you will learn how people with disabilities use the web including different types of assistive technologies and adaptive strategies.

Natalia: You will also learn how web accessibility improves user experience of older people, people using mobile devices, and essentially for everyone.

Shadi: And, of course, you'll also learn all about the international standards from W3C -- and training materials and learn first steps in creating accessible web content.

Natalia: This course was designed for technical and non-technical people. If you work with digital technologies this course is ideal for you to get started.
