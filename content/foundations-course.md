## Who it is for

{% comment %}
This abuses the video-card component and tries to make it work with an embedded YouTube player that is enhanced with the AblePlayer library. Remove and replace with regular video-card component in case of bugs.

**Transcript:**

Shadi: I'm Shadi Abou-Zahra, Accessibility Strategy and Technology Specialist at W3C, the World Wide Web Consortium.

Natalia: I'm Natalia Amelina, Senior National Project Officer in Education at the UNESCO Institute for Information Technologies in Education.

Shadi: Join us in this course to learn the fundamental skills and key resources that are becoming increasingly important across digital professions.

Natalia: In according with statistics, people with disabilities can make up around 15% of the population -- and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities recognizes access to information as a human right. And you may know that this Convention was ratified by 180 countries all over the world, very likely including your country too.

Shadi: In this course you will learn how people with disabilities use the web including different types of assistive technologies and adaptive strategies.

Natalia: You will also learn how web accessibility improves user experience of older people, people using mobile devices, and essentially for everyone.

Shadi: And, of course, you'll also learn all about the international standards from W3C -- and training materials and learn first steps in creating accessible web content.

Natalia: This course was designed for technical and non-technical people. If you work with digital technologies this course is ideal for you to get started.
