## 

The online course "**[Introduction to Web Accessibility](https://www.edx.org/course/web-accessibility-introduction)**" provides a strong foundation for making websites, apps, and other digital technology:

-  work well for people with disabilities
-  meet international standards
-  enhance the user experience for everyone

## Who it is for

The course is designed for **technical and non-technical** learners, including:

- developers
- designers
- content authors
- project managers
- people with disabilities
- others

Optional course materials help you learn more about the topics you are most interested in. It covers:

- What is Web Accessibility (2 sections)
- People and Digital Technology (5 sections)
- Business Case and Benefits (2 sections)
- Principles, Standards, and Checks (5 sections)
- Getting Started with Accessibility (2 sections)

## Duration

The course is designed to take most people about **16-20 hours to complete**. It is listed as 4 weeks of  4-5 hours effort per week. It is **self-paced** so you can complete it in a shorter or longer time frame.

Through early 2021, the current course will be available via edX. We expect to keep an updated version of this course available long term.

## Cost: Free, optional certificate

**The course is free.** The audit option gives you access to all of the content, including the graded assessments.

Optionally, you can choose to get a **Verified Certificate** for $99 USD to demonstrate successful course completion. The Certificate can be printed, listed in resumes, and linked to from online profiles.

You can start auditing the course now, and later choose to get a Verified Certificate.

Certificate Verification: For information on verification options and accessibility of the Verified Certificate process, see: [edX Help Center Accessibility pages](https://support.edx.org/hc/en-us/sections/360007007533-Accessibility).

  <p>In addition to being an excellent introduction for people who are new to accessibility, this course helps people who already know about accessibility fill in gaps. It covers resources from the WAI website, and helps you know how to find more information on multiple aspects of digital accessibility.</p>
